For regression, one grows $B$ deep (unpruned) regression trees on $B$ bootstrapped datasets, each of which has [low bias but high variance](#The-Bias-Variance-Tradeoff), then averages them to get a bootstrap estimate which has the same low bias, but much lower variance. For classification (since we can't average over the classes of the bootstrapped trees) a simple approach is to predict the majority class over the bootstrapped trees.\n",

More generally, $d$ is the interaction depth -- since $d$ splits can involve at most $d$ variables, this controls the interaction order of the boosted model (i.e. the model can fit interaction terms up to degree $d$).\n",
